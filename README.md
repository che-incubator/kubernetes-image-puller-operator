# Kubernetes Image Puller Operator

[![Contribute](https://www.eclipse.org/che/contribute.svg)](https://che.openshift.io/f?url=https://github.com/che-incubator/kubernetes-image-puller-operator)

An operator to install, configure, and manage a [kubernetes-image-puller](https://github.com/che-incubator/kubernetes-image-puller) deployment.

The kubernetes-image-puller creates daemonsets that will run a list of images on your cluster, allowing Eclipse Che to start workspaces faster, because those images have been pre-pulled.  For more information about the kubernetes-image-puller, consult the kubernetes-image-puller [README](https://github.com/che-incubator/kubernetes-image-puller/blob/master/README.md).

The operator provides a `KubernetesImagePuller` custom resource definition (CRD) to install and configure a kubernetes-image-puller instance.

### Example Custom Resource

```yaml
apiVersion: che.eclipse.org/v1alpha1
kind: KubernetesImagePuller
metadata:
  name: image-puller
spec:
  deploymentName: kubernetes-image-puller # the name of the deployment the operator creates
  configMapName: k8s-image-puller # the name of the configmap the operator creates
  daemonsetName: k8s-image-puller # the name of subsequent daemonsets created by the kubernetes-image-puller
  images: >- # the list of images to pre-pull
  	che-theia=quay.io/eclipse/che-theia:next;java11-maven=quay.io/eclipse/che-java11-maven:nightly
  cachingIntervalHours: '2' # number of hours between health checks
  cachingMemoryRequest: '10Mi' # the memory request for each pre-pulled image
  cachingMemoryLimit: '20Mi' # the memory limit for each pre-pulled image
  nodeSelector: '{}' # node selector applied to pods created by the daemonset
```

### Installing The Operator

#### Installing on OperatorHub

#### Installing Manually
``` shell
kubectl apply -f deploy/
kubectl apply -f deploy/crds/
```

There are pull requests to add the operator to the community-operators repository so you can install via OLM:

https://github.com/operator-framework/community-operators/pull/1661

https://github.com/operator-framework/community-operators/pull/1662

### Building

`operator-sdk build quay.io/eclipse/kubernetes-image-puller-operator:tag`

### Testing

`go test -v ./pkg... ./cmd...`

### Releasing a new version of the operator to OperatorHub

A quirk of this project is that while the repository is named `kubernetes-image-puller-operator`, the operator bundle on OperatorHub is named `kubernetes-imagepuller-operator`.  This was caused by the previous version of OLM deployment that required a Quay.io Application.  

1. Change the version in `version/version.go` to match your new operator bundle version.  If your new bundle is v0.5.1, for example, this is what the `Version` var should be in `version/version.go`.
2. Make a directory in `deploy/olm-catalog/kubernetes-imagepuller-operator/VERSION`
3. Run `operator-sdk generate k8s` and `operator-sdk generate crds`
4. Copy a previous version of `kubernetes-imagepuller-operator.vX.X.X.clusterserviceversion.yaml` to the new folder you made in step 2
5. Copy the crd generated by `operator-sdk generate crds` into `deploy/olm-catalog/kubernetes-imagepuller-operator/VERSION`
6. Update `deploy/olm-catalog/kubernetes-imagepuller-operator/kubernetes-imagepuller-operator.package.yaml` to reference the newly-created version

You now have a new version of the CSV and CRD, and can open a PR to `kubernetes-image-puller-operator` to keep everything in sync.

Then, to see these changes on OperatorHub:
1. Clone the [`community-operators`](https://github.com/operator-framework/community-operators) repository.
2. Copy `deploy/olm-catalog/kubernetes-imagepuller-operator/` to [`community-operators/community-operators` and `community-operators/upstream-community-operators`](https://github.com/operator-framework/community-operators)
3. Open two separate pull requests to [community-operators](https://github.com/operator-framework/community-operators), one for `community-operators` and one for `upstream-community-operators`.
